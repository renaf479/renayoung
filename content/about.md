Hello! I'm **Serena Young**. I'm a web developer with 10 years of industry experience. Currently a *Software Engineer* for **IBM Watson Campaign Automation**, a digital marketing automation platform.

In the past, I've worked as a *Technical Lead* at **Live Nation** where I oversaw a team of developers for Insomniac Events, their EDM marketing and promotion division. I've also worked in the online ad industry, pioneering a business initiative to bring third-party ads inhouse through the creation of the **Origin** platform at **Evolve Media, LLC**.

Though I've handled backend development - such as in Java - my main passion is in frontend technologies. I'm known obsessing over UX/UI minutiae such as animation timing and load performance.
