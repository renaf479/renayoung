I joined **IBM** as a *Software Engineer (Fronted Developer)* on their **IBM Watson Campaign Automation** platform - a cloud based digital marketing platform that allows clients to reach their audience through a variety of channels like email, SMS, and mobile.

Here I work with numerous remote teams distributed across the US. While I specialize in frontend feature development, I also pitch in with the backend development work done in Java with the Spring Framework, with unit tests and automation tests done through Fitnesse.
