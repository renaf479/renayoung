I worked as a *Technical Lead* under the **Insomniac** group, which promoted EDM festivals, within **Live Nation**. In this role, I oversaw a remote team of about a half-dozen developers.

Our goal were to work with the designers and marketing managers to execute the microsite lifecycle covering over 20 festival properties. A typical lifecycle would involve an initial splash site.

At a later date we would update the site to include a countdown towards ticket purchasing or lineup reveals. Finally it would evolve into a full fledged, multi-page site that contained artist lineups, ticket packages, festival information, and news articles.

On average, we would execute about 10 microsite releases, and an additional three full sites per month. Our team was the first team to start providing our 1.5 million unique monthly users a responsive website experience.
