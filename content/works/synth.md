I've always maintained a side business used to help others with their needs. Synth Venture is the latest branding of this venture.

The projects that come through Synth usually mirror my professional skills in web development - microsites, small business sites, and the ilk. The more interesting service Synth provides is the creation of self-made products.

Like building a custom lightsaber for a niece who's a new fan of Star Wars. What differentiates this from a mass market product is being able to use more sturdier frames, stronger light source, and clearer audio.
