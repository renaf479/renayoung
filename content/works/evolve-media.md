I worked as a *Software Engineer (Web Developer)* under several departments at **Evolve Media, LLC**. During my time with the inhouse ad agency department, I saw an opportunity to break our reliance on third-party ad vendors. I pioneered the business initiative to form an inhouse ad products team, **Origin**.

During the gradual rollout of our new inhouse ads in the first year, we've achieved over 150 million ad impressions with only two ad products. Saving millions in vendor fees, this also simultaneously creating a revenue stream from collecting our own ad serving fees.

In addition to providing industry standard ad products, we also developed new types of ads. Such as one that combined a cinemagraph with parallax effects as show below. Mouse or tilt your device.
