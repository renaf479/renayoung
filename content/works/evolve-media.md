I worked as a *Software Engineer (Web Developer)* under several departments at **Evolve Media, LLC**.

First I worked on their network of 30 owned and operated sites before moving to their inhouse ad agency team. At this time, Flash based ads were on the decline as HTML/CSS ads were increasing due to the expanding mobile market. Seeing an opportunity to break our reliance on third-party ad vendors, I pioneered the business initiative to form an inhouse ad products team, **Origin**.

During the gradual rollout of our new inhouse ads in the first year, we've achieved over 150 million ad impressions with only two ad products. Saving millions in vendor fees, this also simultaneously creating a revenue stream from collecting our own ad serving fees.

In addition to migrating our existing product offerings to **Origin**, we also begun to prototype new types of ads such as one that combined a cinemagraph with parallax effects as show below. Mouse or tilt your device.
