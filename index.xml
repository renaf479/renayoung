      <description>I joined IBM as a Software Engineer (Fronted Developer) on their IBM Watson Campaign Automation platform - a cloud based digital marketing platform that allows clients to reach their audience through a variety of channels like email, SMS, and mobile.
Here I work with numerous remote teams distributed across the US. While I specialize in frontend feature development, I also pitch in with the backend development work done in Java with the Spring Framework, with unit tests and automation tests done through Fitnesse.</description>

      <description>I worked as a Technical Lead under the Insomniac group, which promoted EDM festivals, within Live Nation. In this role, I oversaw a remote team of about a half-dozen developers.
Our goal were to work with the designers and marketing managers to execute the microsite lifecycle covering over 20 festival properties. A typical lifecycle would involve an initial splash site.
At a later date we would update the site to include a countdown towards ticket purchasing or lineup reveals.</description>

      <description>I worked as a Software Engineer (Web Developer) under several departments at Evolve Media, LLC. During my time with the inhouse ad agency department, I saw an opportunity to break our reliance on third-party ad vendors. I pioneered the business initiative to form an inhouse ad products team, Origin.
During the gradual rollout of our new inhouse ads in the first year, we&amp;rsquo;ve achieved over 150 million ad impressions with only two ad products.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always maintained a side business used to help others with their needs. Synth Venture is the latest branding of this venture.
The projects that come through Synth usually mirror my professional skills in web development - microsites, small business sites, and the ilk. The more interesting service Synth provides is the creation of self-made products.
Like building a custom lightsaber for a niece who&amp;rsquo;s a new fan of Star Wars.</description>
